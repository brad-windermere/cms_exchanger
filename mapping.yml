# Map Office 365 Exchange fields to CMS fields. The keys are Exchange,
# their values are CMS. If a value contains a hash with an array as
# it's value the app will treat that as a list of fields that need to
# be concatenated. It will use the key of the hash as the name of a
# method to call in order to concatenate them, e.g. zip_code(array).

# All exchange fields are included as keys, even if we are not mapping
# a CMS field to them. This is so the app can use them to build the
# headers for the import file it generates to do the exchange import.
